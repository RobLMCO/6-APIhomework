            Higher temperatures are between the tropical latitudes of -23.5 (Capricorn) to 23.5 (Cancer). <BR>
            Much lower temperatures in the higher latitudes compared with the lower latitudes - there happens to be more cities in the most northern latitudes compared with the southern latitudes (based on land mass)
